# Who Am I

Hi, I'm Abdo, I'm an enthusiastic and humorous guy with roots in Egypt
and born in Austria, who loves to program and help others. I'm a
huge open source enthusiast and really interested in computer
graphics.
Currently, I'm working on 2 projects:

-   3D Computer Graphics with WebGPU (Bachelor Thesis)
-   A OSS restaurant delivery platform build with Svelte-Kit and Fastify.

The beginning of 2021 and the months after were a bit tough because my
father had just died, but my friends and family were here and gave me
strength and that's why I love helping and collaborating with other
because they give you the power to do anything. In my free time I like
watching Anime, TV-Shows, playing basketball, football, going out or
to the gym and reading books and comics.
